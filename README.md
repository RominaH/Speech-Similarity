# Speech-Similarity
Cosine Similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two word vectors by calculating the dot product of the 2 vectors and dividing by their magnitudes.
The Soft Cosine Similarity adds on to this idea by taking into consideration the semantic similarity of the words in each vector as well.
This projects calculates both the cosine and soft cosine similarity of Michelle Obama's speech at the DNC in 2008 and Melania Trump's speech at the RNC in 2016.
